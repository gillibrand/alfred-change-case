# Change Case â€” Workflow for Alfred

Changes the case of text selected, provided, or on the clipboard to UPPERCASE, lowercase, Title Case, CamelCase, kebab-case, or snake_case. Now works with diacritics.

[Download the workflow](https://github.com/bpetrynski/alfred-change-case/releases/).

Python 3 is required, [install it before use](https://installpython3.com/mac/).

## Usage

Change the case of text on the keyboard with the keyword `case`. All six styles are previewed as Alfred results. Select one to copy it to the clipboard and paste into in the current application.

Optionally, any text typed after `case` will be changed instead of the clipboard.
